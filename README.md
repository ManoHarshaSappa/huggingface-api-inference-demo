# Hugging Face API Inference - AI vs Human Text Detector

Previously, I built a project using a fine-tuned BERT model to detect AI-generated and human-written text.

In this project, I used the `roberta-base-openai-detector` model from Hugging Face, just to compare its results with my own BERT-based model.

It's a simple comparison setup — nothing fancy, just checking if both give similar outputs.

You can check out my BERT model project here:

It's open-source, and if anyone wants to modify or improve it — you're always welcome!

**Results**  
Honestly, my model is also giving accurate results when I compare it with `roberta-base-openai-detector`, which is a great sign.

I'm still learning, so if you know more or have suggestions — feel free to share. I’m always open to improving and learning more.
